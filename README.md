## 📌 Project Overview
This dissertation focuses on **Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)**, exploring the mapping function from low-resolution (LR) inputs to high-resolution (HR) outputs. [cite_start]As a project in the **Scientific Data Analysis** stream, the research emphasizes critical analysis of current architectures and identifying research gaps in existing literature[cite: 5, 109].

### Core Objectives:
* [cite_start]**Background Study**: Establish the academic context and scientific background of ISR[cite: 29, 83].
* [cite_start]**Literature Synthesis**: Compare and contrast different deep learning approaches (CNNs, Transformers) to motivate the research problem[cite: 109, 417].
* [cite_start]**Performance Evaluation**: Define a testing strategy to demonstrate success via metrics like PSNR and SSIM[cite: 33].
