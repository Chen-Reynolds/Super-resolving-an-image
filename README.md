## 📌 Project Overview
This dissertation focuses on **Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)**, exploring the mapping function from low-resolution (LR) inputs to high-resolution (HR) outputs. As a project in the **Scientific Data Analysis** stream, the research emphasizes critical analysis of current architectures and identifying research gaps in existing literature.

### Core Objectives:
* **Background Study**: Establish the academic context and scientific background of ISR.
* **Literature Synthesis**: Compare and contrast different deep learning approaches (CNNs, Transformers) to motivate the research problem.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Define a testing strategy to demonstrate success via metrics like PSNR and SSIM.
